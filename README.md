#### Packages
**Pip packages:** \
`PyGObject matplotlib pydexcom`

**OS packages:** \
Arch: `gtk4 gtk4-layer-shell gobject-introspection` \
Install the associated packages for your distro.

## Run
```
chmod +x dexwidget.py
./dexwidget.py
```
Or execute in preferred bar:
e.g waybar: `"on-click": "~/.local/bin/dexwidget.py"`

## Notes
Based on my [waybar-dexcom](https://github.com/Narmis-E/waybar-dexcom) module, with looks from [dexviewer](https://github.com/Narmis-E/dexviewer), but turned into a gtk4 widget (thanks to ai). \
Dexcom SHARE username, password and window position are hardcoded into dexwidget.py. Open in a text editor to change.

## Todo
- [ ] Figure out how to close on unfocus/click outside window
- [ ] Add keybindings for changing bg range (e.g 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h)
- [ ] Decrease startup time (optimise matplotlib or replace altogether) (ergo remove need for GLib wheel spinner)
- [ ] Add Dark/Light mode functionality?
- [ ] Logging to json file for extended history
- [ ] Settings (username, password, window position, mg/dL/mmol units etc.)
